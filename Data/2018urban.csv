Caveats:
"1. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when location of Death's Occurrence, Autopsy, Place of Death, Weekday or"
"Month are grouped by or limited, due to lack of a valid population. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#NotApplicableRates."
"2. These items in the results table are not fully selected: Other bacterial diseases, Renal failure. The Query Description lists"
"the actual values selected."
"3. Beginning with the 2018 data, changes have been implemented that affect the counts for ICD-10 cause of death codes O00-O99"
"compared to previous practice. In addition, data for the cause of death codes O00-O99 for 2003 through 2017 reflect differences"
"in information available to individual states and probable errors. Deaths with the underlying cause classified with O00-O99 are"
"subject to further processing before these deaths records are considered final. Provisional deaths have not undergone full"
"processing and review and therefore should not be considered final for statistical purposes. Caution should be used in"
"interpreting these data. More information can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/maternal-mortality/."
"4. On March 11, 2021, the 2019 mortality data on CDC WONDER was updated with the 2019 mortality data updated by NCHS on March 4,"
"2021 to include corrected information for residents of Texas affecting 5 records previously coded to cause code *U01.4,"
"Terrorism involving firearms (homicide). The underlying and multiple cause of death codes for 5 records were corrected in the"
"2019 data. Underlying and multiple cause of death codes for those 5 records were recoded to Assault (homicide) by other and"
"unspecified firearm discharge, ICD-10 code X95. The corrected final death records replaces the data released on December 22,"
"2020."
"5. Connecticut population estimates for 2022 and later years are reported for 9 planning regions as county equivalent areas,"
"instead of the former 8 legacy counties in the Vintage 2022 postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on June 22, 2023,"
"and in the Vintage 2023 postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on June 27, 2024. Populations estimates for the former"
"counties are not available for 2022 and later years. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Connecticut-2022."
"6. After the creation of the final 2023 dataset, North Carolina updated the cause of death information for over 900 death"
"certificates to include a cause of death code indicating drug overdose (ICD-10 underlying cause-of-death codes: X40-X44,"
"X60-X64, X85, and Y10-Y14). Jurisdictions can continue to update death certificates after the closing of the mortality file. As"
"a result, users should consider that the actual death count for drug overdose deaths for North Carolina in 2023 is over 4,400"
"deaths, with a crude rate of approximately 41.0 per 100,000 population, and an age-adjusted rate of approximately 42.1 per"
"100,000 population. These deaths will not be updated on the final mortality datasets."
"7. Changes to cause of death classification affect reporting trends. More information:"

"8. Deaths related to external causes of injury or sudden death: In the provisional mortality data, causes of death classified as"
"external causes of injury (ICD-10 codes V01-Y89), sudden deaths (ICD-10 codes R95 and R96), or drug poisoning (ICD-10 codes"
"T36-T50), have the cause of death labeled as 'Data not shown due to 6 month lag to account for delays in death certificate"
"completion for certain causes of death.' For these deaths occurring 24 weeks prior to the final date in the provisional data,"
